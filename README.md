PROBLEM STATEMENT
The project's objective is to create a credit card fraud detection system using the 
Naive Bayes classifier, with the aim of accurately identifying fraudulent 
transactions while minimizing false positives. By leveraging machine learning 
methodologies, we seek to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of fraud 
detection processes, ultimately mitigating financial losses for both financial 
institutions and customers.Through the utilization of the Naive Bayes classifier, 
which is renowned for its simplicity and effectiveness in probabilistic 
classification tasks, we aim to develop a robust model capable of processing large 
volumes of transaction data in real-time. The system will undergo rigorous testing 
and validation to ensure its reliability and accuracy in detecting fraudulent 
activities.
By implementing this fraud detection system, financial institutions can strengthen 
their security measures, safeguarding against fraudulent transactions and 
preserving the trust and confidence of their customers. Additionally, customers 
will benefit from increased protection against unauthorized charges, contributing 
to a safer and more secure financial environment overall.

ALGORITHMS USED
The algorithm used for the above project is the Naive Bayes classifier. This 
classifier is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem
with the "naive" assumption of feature independence. Despite its simplistic 
assumption, the Naive Bayes classifier has shown effectiveness in various 
classification tasks, including text classification, spam filtering, and credit card 
fraud detection.
The conditional probability can be calculated using the joint probability, although 
it would be intractable. Bayes Theorem provides a principled way for calculating 
the conditional probability. The simple form of the calculation for Bayes 
Theorem is as follows:
 P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
, where P(A|B) is "posterior probability" = prob. of hypothesis A for given data 
B, P(B|A) is the prob. of data B given hypothesis A is true, P(A) "prior prob of 
A" being true regardless of data, P(B) prob. of data regardless of hypo.

REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION
In this project, several essential Python packages are required to facilitate data 
manipulation, visualization, and implementation of machine learning algorithms 
for credit card fraud detection. 
Firstly, `numpy` and `pandas` are fundamental libraries for data manipulation 
and analysis. They provide powerful tools for handling structured data, including 
functions for data cleaning, manipulation, and transformation. These packages 
enable efficient data preprocessing and feature engineering, crucial steps in 
developing accurate machine learning models.
Secondly, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are indispensable for data visualization. 
These libraries offer a wide range of plotting functionalities to visualize trends, 
distributions, and relationships within the data. Effective data visualization aids 
in understanding the underlying patterns and anomalies in credit card 
transactions, facilitating informed decision-making during model development 
and evaluation.
Lastly, `scikit-learn` (also known as sklearn) is a comprehensive machine 
learning library that provides a vast array of algorithms and tools for model 
training, evaluation, and deployment. It offers user-friendly interfaces for 
implementing various machine learning techniques, including the Naive Bayes 
classifier, which is the focus of this project. Sklearn also provides performance 
evaluation metrics, such as confusion matrices, precision, recall, F1-score, and 
ROC AUC, essential for assessing the effectiveness of the fraud detection model.
By ensuring the installation of these packages in the Python environment, 
one can seamlessly execute the code and leverage the functionalities 
offered by these libraries to build a robust credit card fraud detection system.
